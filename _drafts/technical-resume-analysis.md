Do you want to get internship opportunity? find a job? in US?
Then you should be ready to ~~make it your signature~~ attach your resume
to every letter you send.

You can find plenty of articles about "How to write resume" by [Google-ing](#).
But I want to point out some common mistakes people do.

**NOTE!** All information here is based on my experience @ Google, so you should
take it as advice, not as a rule of thumb.

My goal is to show how to find and correct mistakes, so today we are going to
analyze real resume, almost real :)

## Meet our assistant

Let's have a look at Pikachu's resume. He is trying to get an internship
at the [Big Search Engine](#) company.

![resume]({{ '/assets/img/pikachu_resume_v0.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

~~Wow, it's so cool!~~ Ready? Let's start:

1.  **Avoid links, unless you have REAL reason to use them.**
		Though link provides additional 'hypertextual' information, resume is
		bad place for them(*try portfolio instead*). In some rare
		cases(e.g. scientific articles), you can include link in your resume,
		but it should be short(see [bit.ly](#), [goo.gl](#)) and clear.

2.  **Use standard format for address and phone number.**
		Recruiter can use information from your resume to contact you by phone.
		Using standard phone number format will guarantee that all
		phones will recognize it.
		*A simple [search](#) can help you figure out what format you should use.*

3.  **Get yourself one good-looking email address.**
		Resume is a document in official style. Do you really think that
		`p1kach00@nowhere.dash` is what HR people want to see?
		*You can set up mail forwarding to synchronize several email accounts.*

4.  **Usually you don't need to have 'personal details' part.**
		This part should include very important information about you, not just:
		'strong analytical skills', 'problem solving skills', etc.
		~~How about 'Nobel Laureate in Maths'?~~

5.  **Include enough information about the place you want to point to.**
		That advice matches every place you want to put into resume. Where did you
		go to school? How about work experience?
		*Just try to look at [Wikipedia](#).*

6.  **Write about your achievements.**
		The most important information in your 'experience' part is achievements
		you accomplished. You can write what you 'was doing', but more valuable is
		what you 'have done'. *Though it's a bit [controversial point](http://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/avoid-the-top-10-resume-mistakes).*

7.  **Avoid non-informative words and repetitions.**
		These words drives HR people crazy:) Really. ~~What is the difference between
		Go and golang? Is there non-mobile version of Pokemon Go?~~
		*See more examples [here](http://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/10-words-ruin-resume).*

8.  **Omit 'I'.**
		Do you remember that rule from school?
		Try to rephrase each sentence, so that it starts with 'Developed',
		'Achieved', 'Increased/Reduced', bet you have got the point.
		*Have you noticed, how many times Pikachu used 'I'?*

9.  **Avoid TYPOS.**
		What do you think can ordinary recruiter get from your resume except
		general information? ~~No, not tech abbreviations and abstractions you used
		in project description.~~ Of course you are right.
		*BTW, how many typos can you find in Pikachu's resume?*

10. **Do not use abbreviations and tech terminology a lot.**
		Yes, your application will be processed by special committee, but
		before it will be stored only on the desktop of the recruiter.
		~~Not every~~ recruiter can understand that ML is Machine Learning, and not
		Memory Leak.

11. **Care confidential information.**
		Pikachu should be a very good developer to work on so critical part
		of project as API security, but Big Search Engine company will not hire
		him. *How do you think, what is he going to add to resume after
		internship?*

~~Oh, stop it! I have forgot the first tip.~~ Let's stop here and see what is
~~our~~ Pikachu's resume now looks like.
